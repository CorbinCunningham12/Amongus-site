                The headquarters of the un-named presumed company that hires these crewmates that serve as the players.<br><br>
                Many assume that the Imposters are implants made by a foreign force that has unknown motives, until now. <br><br>
                We beleive that the Imposters are actually Cordesceps fungus that act autonomously via hive coordination utilizing a queen as the determining figue behind their movements. <br><br>
                Many scientists back this fact so hard you should know about it so I'm not going to link a source. <br><br>
